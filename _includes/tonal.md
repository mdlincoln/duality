Why did Dutch painters turn towards more tonal painting in the 1620s?

This deceptively simple question has arisen many times in histories of seventeenth-century Dutch painting. However, there has been little in the way of critical evaluation.

In 1980 N. Vroom authored the work _A Modest Message_, an investigation of monochromatic still lifes.[^vroom]
Though filling three volumes, Vroom reaches few conclusions about the coherence of monochromatic or tonal painting as a category, much less an understanding of its causes or meaning.
Indeed, Vroom's work has been characterized by one prominent historian of Dutch painting as having set bak the discipline by decades.[^econ]

This question is an ideal example of the interleaved, recursive nature of quantitative assumptions and arguments built into seemingly-qualitative research.
Let's parse the question "Why did Dutch painters turn towards more tonal painting in the 1620s?" more closely.

1. What _is_ tonal painting? There are a variety of definitions: a painting with
a restricted range of hues; with thinly-applied paint; simple and repetitive
compositions. Each of these characteristics can, in turn, be broken down into
measurable (i.e. quantitative) components. One might attempt to quantify these
attributes through image processing or systematic pigment analysis. Equally
valid (and likely easier!) one might simply rank hue, composition, and paint
application by eye, hewing to a simple number scale.
