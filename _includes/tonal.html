  <h1>Matthew Lincoln: Measuring Tonal Paintings</h1>
</header>

<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
<p>Why did Dutch painters turn towards more tonal painting in the 1620s? This deceptively simple question has arisen many times in histories of seventeenth-century Dutch painting, addressed purely as a step in stylistic evolution, to a strategic reaction by artists to changing economic supply and demand.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But what <em>is</em> tonal painting, anyway? Restricted palette? Thin paint application? Simple composition? What do we mean by &quot;turn&quot;? How many artworks, or how many artists, in how short a span of time, constitutes a significant shift? One might attempt to quantify palette through image processing or systematic pigment analysis. Yet it might be equally productive to rank hue, composition, and paint application by eye, hewing to a simple number scale. Any of these approaches may be aided or hampered by a lack of measurable evidence.</p>

<blockquote>In this visualization, questions and concepts are clustered by theme (e.g. what is tonal painting itself, what constitutes a shift, and what the causal factors may be). By mousing over one of these elements, you can highlight the subcomponents (in red) of that element, and the parent components (in green) that, in turn, reference that element. A "starting point" is marked at the top of the diagram in capital lettering, however the user is free to navigate from there.
</blockquote>

<p>This visualization suggests the interwoven nature of the components needed to evaluate this question; the interleaved, recursive nature of quantitative assumptions and arguments built into seemingly-qualitative research. No question, not even ones predicated on highly subjective interpretation such as the tracking of intellectual or artistic movements, are independent of a sense of comparative quantity that makes it possible for us to claim a trend is becoming more or less prevalent.</p>
<p>Rather than treating qualitative and quantitative approaches as oppositional, or even as complementary-but-separate modes of research, we would do better to drop the distinction in favor of a research model that finds value in recursive investigation, drilling into standing assumptions.</p>
