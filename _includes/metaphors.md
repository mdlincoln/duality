In the process of developing this provocation, we continually returned to a series of visual metaphors. We present them here as documentation, but also as inspiration for future work:

- Fractal
- Cycle
- Rhizomatic
- River
- National border
- Sides of a coin
- Black hole
- Network
- Light as particles and waves
