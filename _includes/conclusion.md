We offer these as guiding points and questions for designing a humanistic experiment that embraces the quantitative/qualitative duality:

- The model is an argument for how you believe the world (or one small part of it - your object of research) works - encoding your assumptions, hypotheses, and evaluative methods.
- What are the dimensions/features/characteristics of this model, in all its multiplicity?
- In what was can you responsibly abstract your objects of research into data?
- How can you measure these data --- even in a very subjective and contingent way --- as a way to evaluate the validity of your model?
- No one set of data, no one measurement, will give you a synthetic or objective view of all the dimensions of your model. Rather, you must experiment iteratively and recursively with multiple models, multiple measurements, and multiple datasets.
- It is the process of this iteration --- not any single result --- that tends to be the most valuable scholarly output.
