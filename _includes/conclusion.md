- The model is an argument for how you believe the world (or one small part of it - your object of research) works.
- What are the dimensions/features/characteristics of this model, in all its multiplicity?
- In what ways can you represent these dimensions as data?
- How can you measure these data --- even in a very subjective and contingent way --- as a way to evaluate the validity of your model?
- No one set of data, no one measurement, will give you a synthetic or objective view of all the dimensions of your model. All these elements are interpenetrating, recursive, iterative. It is the process of this interaction --- not any single result --- that is the scholarly output.
- subjective quantification
